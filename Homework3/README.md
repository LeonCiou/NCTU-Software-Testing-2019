# Homework3
For homework3, I must design tests to satisfy PC(predicates coverage), CC(clause coverage), and CACC(correlated active clause coverage) for Themostat .

## PC
First, look at Line(28-30):`if (((curTemp < dTemp - thresholdDiff) ||
           (override && curTemp < overTemp - thresholdDiff)) &&
           (timeSinceLastRun > minLag))`

## CC


## CACC
